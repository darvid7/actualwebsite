Hi 👋I'm David, born, raised in Melbourne Australia 🇦🇺the most livable city on Earth 🌏I studied Software Engineering at Monash University and just completed my honours thesis incorporating Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Graphs (some Machine Learning stuff) 🎓 More recently, I've moved to Sydney and started as a Software Engineer at Google where I help make awesome applications that run on multiple devices and the web! You can read more about my [work experience here](/resume). In my spare time I travel ✈️, look for dogs to pet 🐶, eat food ☕️🍕🍣 , binge watch Netflix shows 📺and find cool side [projects](/projects) to work on 💻. 

I've been fortunate enough to visit 🇲🇾🇸🇬🇫🇯🇮🇹🇬🇧🇺🇸🇦🇪🇫🇷🇯🇵🇹🇼and will hopefully be adding a few more in the future!


Thanks for checking out my website!

I'm always open to new ideas and projects and am open to freelance work! Feel free to get in touch.

I'm self taught in web technologies and have worked across the stack in various projects including backend (Flask, SpringBoot, Node.js), frontend (React.js, jquery, polymer) and mobile (Android, React Native) work. Currently I am trying to up skill myself in TypeScript and TensorFlow.
## Work Experience 

### Google 
<img src="/images/google_logo.png" width="45" align="left"/> 
I've just started at Google as a Software Engineer on <img src="/images/chrome.jpg" width="20"/> Chrome OS. Prior to that I was lucky enough to be able to intern at Google twice. My first internship was on the Network SRE team where I was dealing with data from connecting ISPs. My most recent internship was on the [Google Maps Location Sharing](https://blog.google/products/maps/share-your-trips-and-real-time-location-google-maps/) team where I managed to [launch two features](/ramblings/maps_internship) to millions of users world wide, they are now live on the Google Maps <img src="/images/maps.png" width="20"/> Mobile applications! Some of my work was actually discovered by Android Police APK teardowns: [battery](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/03/19/google-maps-v9-73-beta-prepares-allow-reviews-saved-drafts-odd-even-road-rules-jakarta-apk-teardown/), [time zone](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/03/19/google-maps-v9-73-beta-prepares-allow-reviews-saved-drafts-odd-even-road-rules-jakarta-apk-teardown/).

### Monash University
<img src="/images/monash.jpg" width="45" align="left"/> 
At university was a honours student (first class), teaching associate and web developer.
My honours thesis was supervised by [Dr. Yuan-Fang Li](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/yuan-fang-li) and [Dr. Lan Du](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/lan-du) in the Faculty of Information Technology. It is focused on a Natural Language Processing approach for Knowledge Graph embeddings, I hope it will contribute to the fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
I'm was a teaching associate running labs, tutorials and marking exams for [Object Oriented Design & Implementation](http://www.monash.edu/pubs/2018handbooks/units/FIT2099.html) and [Algorithm fundamentals in Python](http://www.monash.edu/pubs/2018handbooks/units/FIT1045.html).
Additionally, I worked within the student innovation space on web projects that were originally open sourced, but now acquired (and funded) by the university.

### Accenture
<img src="/images/accenture.jpg" width="45" align="left"/> 
I was a Technical Analyst at Accenture for a while, working on projects to automate business processes which involved using Python, Splunk, JQuery & AWS. I was also a mentor for the Accenture Technology Bootcamp (a 1 week hackathon) leading a team of 6 students.

## Other Relevant Bits
I've done some other things that might be relevant:

<img src="/images/facebook.png" width="40" align="right"/> 

- Attending tech talks and hackathons. My biggest hackathon achievement is **winning the Facebook Melbourne hackathon**, which comes with a free trip to **San Francisco** to compete in **Facebook‚Äôs World Hackathon Finals** where we **placed 2nd**  competing against teams form **MIT, Standford, London, Brazil & Poland** just to name a few!
- **Global Discovery Scholar** in **New York City** üóΩan entrepreneurial program funded by alumni where I got to pick at the brains of some very well established industry leaders in New York as well as my peers
- Sometimes complete at **ICPC** competitions, best result was **3rd** in **VCPC** (state wide) üéâ
- I occasionally volunteer with [Wired Monash](http://wired.org.au/) & [Robogals](https://robogals.org/) in my spare time
- **Cliff Bellamy award** (founding Dean of the Faculty of IT) for the **highest achieving 3rd year undergraduate**
- Highest grade in my cohort for some units, most notably **99** in 3rd year **Artificial Intelligence** and **Software Architecture**
- **Competitive swimmer** üèä(during high school) taking out multiple **state titles**

I also work on some cool side projects, check some of them out [here](/projects).

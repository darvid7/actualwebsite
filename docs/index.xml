      <description>Over the past summer (2017 - 2018) I worked on the Google Maps Location Sharing team! Location Sharing in Maps allows you to share your location with someone. Typical use cases include sharing with family members when overseas and sharing with friends to try meet up somewhere. I worked on two features to improve the user experience when sharing location by providing more information to the person being shared with, I can now talk about because they launched!</description>

      <description>World! I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what I&amp;rsquo;m going to do with this, I guess this is a blog of sorts although using a blogging platform like medium will probably be easier 🤔&amp;hellip;I guess I just like writing in *.md.</description>

      <description>Projects I&amp;rsquo;ve done a range of hackathons, random side projects and a few pieces of polished work. Hopefully this showcases a diverse range of them.
Facebook Global Hackathon Informing you of disasters helping you help others  Realizing the impact of the wildfires in California which were unknown to us before we got to Sillion Valley, we made an application to notify you about disasters nearby so you can prepare for them &amp; help others.</description>
